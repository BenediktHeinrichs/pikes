CorpusPreprocessor takes the original MPQA dataset (as released by its authors) in input and builds:
(1) the NAF files containing the raw sentences to be processed, one sentence per line (i.e., sentence splitting already done)
(2) a file annotations.tsv with a row for each holder/target/opinion extracted from the MPQA dataset
(3) a file annotations.html with a rendering of opinionated sentences with highlighted the holder/target/opinion

Example:
java eu.fbk.fssa.eu.fbk.dkm.pikes.resources.mpqa.CorpusPreprocessor \
    -i /mnt/data/sentiment/database.eu.fbk.dkm.pikes.resources.mpqa.2.0 \
    -o /mnt/data/sentiment/database.eu.fbk.dkm.pikes.resources.mpqa.2.0/naf-raw
    -f /mnt/data/sentiment/database.eu.fbk.dkm.pikes.resources.mpqa.2.0/doclist.attitudeSubset
    -n http://eu.fbk.dkm.pikes.resources.mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/corpora/mpqa_corpus/

Remarks:
- the tool works on the folder structure of the MPQA dataset and takes its root in input with option -i
- option -f points to a file listing the documents to be processed (use doclist.attitudeSubset)
- option -n is the namespace of the URIs of generated NAFs
- call the tool with -h to have more information
- Remove the file ula/AFGP-2002-600175-Trans, as it is garbled.

Pay attention! Options to set:
stanford_break_on_newline = always
stanford_eolonly = 1
stanford_token_whitespace = 0
