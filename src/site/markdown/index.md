<h3 class='no-before'>About</h3>

**PIKES** is a Java-based suite that extracts knowledge from textual resources.
The tool implements a rule-based strategy that reinterprets the output of semantic role labelling (SRL) tools in light
of other linguistic analyses, such as dependency parsing or co-reference resolution, thus properly capturing and
formalizing in RDF important linguistic aspects such as argument nominalization, frame-frame relations, and group
entities.

<h3 class='no-before'>Features</h3>

- Argument nominalization using SRL
- Frame-frame relations extractions
- Entity grouping exploiting linking and co-reference
- Extensible and replaceable NLP pipeline
- Interlinked three-layer representation model exposed as RDF
- Instance RDF triples annotated with detailed information of the mentions (via named graph)
- REST API service included, built on top of [Grizzly](https://grizzly.java.net/)
- Based on [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) and [RDFpro](http://rdfpro.fbk.eu/)
